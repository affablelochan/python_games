   The best possible hand is called a blackjack and it consists of an ace and any 10-point card. A winning blackjack pays 2:1"
   If both the player and the dealer have a tie, including a blackjack tie, it is a 'push' and money is neither lost, nor paid "
   All other winning hands pay even money, 1:1"
   If either the player or the dealer exceed 21 or 'bust' the hand automatically loses."
   If both the dealer and player bust, the player loses."
